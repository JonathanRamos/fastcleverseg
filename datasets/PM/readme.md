# Paravertebral muscles

The reference database [MyoSegmentTUM](https://doi.org/10.21037/qims.2016.08.01) comprises lumbar muscles and vertebral bodies in chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI.

In total, there are 54 MRI exams (15 males and 39 females) of healthy, caucasian volunteers, with average age of 51.6 $\pm$ 16.7 years old.

Each exam presents reference manual segmentation for four muscles (erector spinae left and right as well as psoas left and right) and five lumbar vertebral bodies (from L1 to L5).


The volunteers underwent MRI on a 3T system (Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, Best, Netherlands) using a whole-body coil, built-in 12-channel posterior coil, and a 16-channel anterior coil. 
Subjects were positioned head-first in a supine position.
The segmentations were performed by a board-certified radiologist using the image viewer software MITK (Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit, Heidelberg, Germany).


The manual segmentation took 50 min for each paravertebral muscle.
The axial proton density fat fraction (PDFF) maps were used to separately segment the erector spine and the psoas muscle on both sides from the cranial part of L2 to the caudal part of L5.
